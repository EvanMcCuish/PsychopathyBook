Code used for analyses in book

The main file reflects Stata code used for almost all analyses in the book. 

I used R for the network analyses in Chapter 4 and for some of the mediation analyses in Chapter 7 that required considering the sequential ignorability assumption. 

I used MPlus for the CFA and IRT analyses in Chapter 4
